# Overview Organizer

This project is a simple recipe organizer built with Kotlin. It allows users to register ingredients, their quantities, and detailed step-by-step instructions for preparing recipes.

The purpose of this software is to demonstrate basic Kotlin syntax and features such as variable declaration, functions, control flow, and data structures. The code is structured to reflect clean, idiomatic Kotlin programming practices.
